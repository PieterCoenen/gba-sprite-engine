SPACE DISASTER

In this game you are on a journey through space. Under normal circumstances you would be in a sleep pod the entire journey, 
but something went wrong. Partway through the journey the pod woke you up. And the doors to the other rooms are sealed shut. 
Now it is up to you to reach the pilot chamber and take control of the ship once more. But this is not as easy as you think. 
To ship has activated its security systems and it won't be easy to get to the following rooms. In every room there will be a 
number of trials that you need to complete in order to open the doors. This will get more difficult the more rooms you have
opened. To make it extra hard, the camouflage system is active, this means you will not see the ship, but you will see into space.

At this point there are 2 rooms available. The room where you wake up and the machine room. Both rooms are not so difficult to cross.
But there can be more rooms in the future. It is also possible to choose the color of your character, so you can personalize it a 
little bit.

The controls are very simple:
	-A -> interact with something
	-Arrow keys -> move your avatar

There is one little glitch in the system, if you press A on the splashscreen, you will not be able to choose the color of you avatar.
